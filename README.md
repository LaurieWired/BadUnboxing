# Description

BADUnboxing is an automated Android unpacker. It works by locating and decompiling code inside the APK that is relevant to the unpacking process. 

Once Bad Unboxing detects packing, it automatically generates a new Java application based on the decompiled code. This new application can be executed to drop dynamic unpacked artifacts to disk.
